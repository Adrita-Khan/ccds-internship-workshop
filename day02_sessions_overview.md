On Day 02, two sessions will cover key aspects of machine learning project management and model evaluation:

**Session 01: Managing Projects Using VS Code and Google Colab (Dec 13, 9:30 am - 12:30 pm)**

This session focuses on integrating Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with Google Colab to enhance the development workflow:

- **Developing Source Code in VS Code**: VS Code is a versatile code editor offering features like intelligent code completion, debugging, and version control integration, providing a robust development environment.

- **Running Code in Google Colab**: Google Colab offers free access to computational resources, including GPUs, which are beneficial for machine learning tasks.

- **Integrating VS Code with Google Colab**: Connecting VS Code to Google Colab allows for writing and editing code in VS Code while executing it in the Colab environment, combining the strengths of both platforms for a seamless development experience. Tools like the `colabcode` Python package facilitate this integration. 

**Session 02: Visualizing Loss Curves and Real-Time Model Interaction with wandb.ai and Lightning.ai**

This session explores monitoring and interacting with machine learning models using Weights & Biases (wandb.ai) and Lightning AI (Lightning.ai):

- **Visualizing Loss Curves**: Tracking metrics such as validation loss is crucial for understanding a model's learning process. With Lightning AI, metrics can be logged using the `self.log` method within the `LightningModule`. These logs can be visualized in real-time using tools like TensorBoard or integrated experiment managers. 

- **Real-Time Interaction with the Model Using wandb.ai and Lightning.ai**: Weights & Biases (wandb.ai) is a tool for tracking machine learning experiments, visualizing metrics, and managing model artifacts. PyTorch Lightning (Lightning.ai) is a lightweight wrapper for organizing PyTorch code. Integrating wandb.ai with Lightning.ai enables real-time logging and visualization of metrics, providing better insights into model performance. The `WandbLogger` in Lightning AI facilitates this integration seamlessly. 

By the end of these sessions, participants will acquire practical skills to manage machine learning projects effectively, visualize key metrics, and interact with models in real-time, thereby enhancing development workflows and model evaluation processes.
